## Schedule Structure

schedule.md and schedule_en.md are the sources rendered and inserted into the website on page load.
The schedule files are updated many times a week.

The schedule is organized by day of the week (Monday-Sunday). Each entry follows this format:
- Time. "Club Name". Event type. [Optional notes]

Event types:
- "Гра на столи" / "Ladder games" - Informal play where players rotate tables based on wins.
- "Ігрова група" / "Coach-Guided Matches" - Informal play where players rotate as told by coaches. The first part of the session is usually practice.
- "Рейтинговий турнір X-Y" / "Ranked tournament X-Y" - Official tournament affecting UTTF rating, for players rated X to Y.
- "Нерейтинговий турнір X-Y" / "Unranked tournament X-Y" - Casual tournament, no rating impact.

Rating ranges (e.g., 0-25, 0-100) indicate which players can participate based on their UTTF (Ukrainian Table Tennis Federation) rating.
