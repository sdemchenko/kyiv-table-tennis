For the summer period, the evening pass in "Volia" has got cheaper, it costs as the morning pass.
Thus, t—Äe whole summer you can play for 50 hryvnias per hour regardless of the time of day.
As before, passes do not expire: you can buy a pass for 16 hours and use it throughout the summer (until you use all 16 hours). <a href="https://t.me/skVolyaKvadrat/19807">Source</a>.
