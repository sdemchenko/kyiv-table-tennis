Last Friday, the customs has inspected an shipment from Estonian shop Tabletennis11.
In the process, the customs calculated the full price of the equipment, ignoring both the banking statement and the 30% volume discount.
From now on, when you make a big collective order at tabletennis11, ask them to ship as separate shipments to different people.
There should not be any issues with shipments up to 150 euro per day per person.
